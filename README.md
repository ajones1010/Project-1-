#Project Description/Outline
The aim of our project is to uncover trends and patterns within our data in relation to cardiovascular disease. We will examine trends in symptoms, lifestyles and habits, demographics, rates over time, as well as geographic locations.

#Research Questions to Answer

1)-How has the prevalence of heart disease changed over the past decade, and are there any significant trends or patterns in the occurrence of heart disease over time?
2)-Among chronic diseases, which specific type is the most prevalent in the population, and has its prevalence changed over time?
3)-In which geographic regions or areas are heart disease and other common chronic diseases most prevalent?
4)-How do demographic factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle behaviors (e.g., smoking, diet, physical activity) impact the likelihood of developing heart disease and other chronic diseases?
